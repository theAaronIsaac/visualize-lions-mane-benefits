# Neurological Benefits of Lion's Mane Mushroom

## Neurotrophic Properties

### Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) Stimulation
- Hericenones and erinacines isolated from the medicinal mushroom Hericium erinaceus can induce NGF synthesis in nerve cells.
- NGF is essential for the maintenance of the basal forebrain cholinergic system.
- The aqueous extract of H. erinaceus contains neuroactive compounds which induced NGF-synthesis and promoted neurite outgrowth in NG108-15 cells.

### Neuron Growth and Development
- Laboratory tests measured the neurotrophic effects of compounds isolated from Hericium erinaceus on cultured brain cells.
- The mushroom extract and its active components largely increase the size of growth cones, which are particularly important for brain cells to sense their environment and establish new connections with other neurons in the brain.
- Neurons exposed to lion's mane mushroom extracts were up to twice as long as those not exposed.
- The combination of 10 ng/mL NGF with 1 Î¼g/mL mushroom extract yielded the highest percentage increase of 60.6% neurite outgrowth.

### Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)
- An increase in circulating pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been observed following hericene A (isolated from H. erinaceus) administration in mice.
- Similar effects were observed in overweight humans following H. erinaceus extract supplementation, suggesting a general effect on BDNF synthesis.
- BDNF plays a crucial role in neuronal survival and growth, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function.

## Neuroprotective Effects

### Anti-inflammatory Properties
- In animal models, hericenones and erinacines have been shown to exert anti-neuroinflammatory properties.
- These compounds can easily cross the blood-brain barrier, making them effective for targeting neurological conditions.

### Protection Against Neurodegeneration
- The compounds show promising potential as excellent neuroprotective agents.
- They can regulate inflammatory processes in the brain, which are often associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
- Use of lion's mane or Erinacine A protected neurons and reduced infarct volume after induced stroke in mice.

### Limitations
- The H. erinaceus extract failed to protect NG108-15 cells subjected to oxidative stress when applied in pre-treatment and co-treatment modes.
- The aqueous preparation of H. erinaceus had neurotrophic but not neuroprotective activities in some studies.
- More research is needed to fully understand the neuroprotective mechanisms and their clinical applications.
