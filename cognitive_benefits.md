# Cognitive Benefits of Lion's Mane Mushroom

## Overview
Lion's mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus) has been studied for its potential cognitive benefits. Research suggests that it may improve cognitive function, enhance memory, and potentially protect against neurodegenerative disorders.

## Key Research Findings

### Cognitive Function Improvement
- A double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that following a single dose of Hericium erinaceus (1.8g), participants performed quicker on the Stroop task, suggesting improved cognitive processing speed.
- After 28-day supplementation, a trend towards reduced subjective stress was observed.
- Improvements in scores of mild cognitive impairment were observed in 50-80 year old adults following 16 weeks of 3g/day supplementation.
- Improved scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination were observed in adults aged â‰¥50 years who consumed 3.2g of powdered fruiting body daily for 12 weeks.

### Memory Enhancement
- Research from The University of Queensland discovered that lion's mane mushroom extract had a significant impact on the growth of brain cells and improving memory.
- Dietary supplementation with lion's mane mushroom crude extracts significantly enhanced mice's recognition memory in maze tests.
- The active compounds promote neuron projections, extending and connecting to other neurons, which is important for memory formation.

### Potential for Neurodegenerative Disorders
- Reductions in cognitive decline were observed in patients diagnosed with mild Alzheimer's disease following 49-week supplementation with erinacine A-enriched H. erinaceus.
- The discovery has applications that could treat and protect against neurodegenerative cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
- A clinical trial is ongoing in Korea to test the efficacy of some of these molecules in a cohort of Alzheimer patients.

## Limitations and Considerations
- Many of the human studies have been conducted on older adults or specific clinical samples, typically in models of cognitive decline.
- Limited research has been done on younger, healthy adults.
- The area is still in its infancy, with limited placebo-controlled, double-blind studies.
- Different studies use varying doses of H. erinaceus which are presented in differing forms.
