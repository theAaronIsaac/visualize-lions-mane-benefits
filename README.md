# Lion's Mane Interactive Webpage

## Project Overview
This project is an interactive web application that explores the scientifically-analyzed benefits of Lion's Mane mushroom extract for brain health and neuronal growth. The webpage presents comprehensive research in an engaging, interactive format with visualizations, simulations, and interactive elements.

Live demo: [https://hmuynqkg.manus.space](https://hmuynqkg.manus.space) 

## Features

### Interactive Visualizations
- **3D Brain Model**: Interactive Three.js visualization showing how Lion's Mane affects different brain regions
- **Neuron Growth Simulator**: D3.js-powered simulation demonstrating neuron development with and without Lion's Mane extract
- **Cognitive Performance Charts**: Interactive comparison charts showing benefits across different cognitive domains
- **Research Timeline**: Visual timeline of key scientific studies on Lion's Mane

### Interactive Elements
- **Benefit Cards**: Flip cards presenting cognitive and neurological benefits
- **Bioactive Compounds Explorer**: Tabbed interface for exploring the active compounds in Lion's Mane
- **FAQ Section**: Accordion-style frequently asked questions
- **Study Cards**: Filterable cards presenting research evidence

## Technology Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
