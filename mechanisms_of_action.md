# Mechanisms of Action of Lion's Mane Mushroom

## Bioactive Compounds

### Hericenones
- Found primarily in the fruiting body of the mushroom
- Can induce NGF synthesis in nerve cells
- Can easily cross the blood-brain barrier
- Have been shown to exert anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective properties in animal models

### Erinacines
- Found primarily in the mycelium of the mushroom
- Potent inducers of NGF synthesis
- Can easily cross the blood-brain barrier
- Have shown promising cognition-enhancing effects in animal models
- Erinacine A-enriched H. erinaceus has shown improvements in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease

### Other Bioactive Components
- Polysaccharides with antioxidant properties
- Phenolic acids that contribute to overall neuroprotective effects
- Terpenoids with various bioactive properties

## Neurological Pathways

### NGF Stimulation Pathway
- Lion's mane compounds induce the secretion of extracellular NGF in nerve cells
- NGF is essential for the maintenance of the basal forebrain cholinergic system
- NGF promotes neurite outgrowth activity and neuronal survival
- The combination of NGF with mushroom extract yields synergistic effects on neurite outgrowth

### BDNF Pathway
- Lion's mane compounds increase circulating pro-BDNF
- BDNF plays a crucial role in neuronal survival and growth
- BDNF contributes to synaptic plasticity and cognitive function
- Increased BDNF has been associated with memory and mood enhancements

### Anti-inflammatory Mechanisms
- Reduces neuroinflammation, which is often associated with neurodegenerative diseases
- Regulates inflammatory processes in the brain
- May help protect neurons from inflammatory damage

### Antioxidant Effects
- Reduces oxidative stress in the brain
- Protects neurons from damage caused by free radicals
- Contributes to overall neuroprotective effects

## Cellular Effects

### Growth Cone Enhancement
- Lion's mane extract and its active components increase the size of growth cones
- Growth cones are particularly important for brain cells to sense their environment
- Enhanced growth cones help establish new connections with other neurons in the brain

### Neurite Outgrowth Stimulation
- Promotes the extension of neuron projections
- Helps neurons connect to other neurons
- Neurons exposed to lion's mane extracts were up to twice as long as control neurons
- The combination of 10 ng/mL NGF with 1 Î¼g/mL mushroom extract yielded a 60.6% increase in neurite outgrowth

### Protection Against Neurodegeneration
- Safeguards nerve cells from apoptosis (programmed cell death)
- Protects neurons from damage and degeneration
- May help reduce infarct volume after stroke
- Shows potential for treating and protecting against neurodegenerative cognitive disorders
